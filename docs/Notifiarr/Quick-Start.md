![!open-integrations](images/open-integrations.png)

First, click on  `Manage Integrations` so you can enable what you want to receive notifications for.

![!integration-list](images/integration-list.png)

A screen will popup and here you're able to select from which application/services you receive a notification.

When you enabled the ones you want click on `Save`

Setup which notifications you want to to receive from each option.

![!notification-settings](images/notification-settings.png)

1. Cog wheel, this opens the integration settings
1. External link, this opens the website for the integration
1. WIKI link, this opens any extra wiki information available for the integration
1. Triggers, this enables/disables a specific trigger for the integration
1. Channels, this sets the channel in your server to post to for the integration

### Discord Settings

Here we will cover the following

- Setup the server & shared error channel
- Invite the bot into your server
- Setup reactions
- Setup indexer reactions

#### Create the channels

First thing to do is create a few channels (in your discord server) where you receive your notifications.

!!! note
    I won't be explaining how to setup a discord channel, that's up to you but google has plenty of references.

You can do it all from one channel or separate the notifications (granular) for each trigger if you want.

#### Simple channel setup

`#media` => All the `*arr` notifications you setup in [Integration Settings](#integration-settings).

`#errors` => Health checks, network errors, etc.

`#plex` => Play, resume, etc. for Plex.

After you create the needed channels, it's time to add them to the `Setup the channels`

First we need to get the server ID

Open your User Settings -> Appearance -> Enable Developer Mode.

![!dn-discord-dev-mode](images/dn-discord-dev-mode.png)

 Right click on your server name and select "Copy ID"

??? example "Example right click"
    ![!dn-discord-copyid](images/dn-discord-copyid.png)

Paste the server ID in box `[1]`

![!discord-server](images/discord-server.png)

1. Add your server ID
1. Select the channel for the `#errors` channel.

### Invite the bot

It's time to invite the bot in to your Server/Channels by clicking on the following link.

![!dn-invite-bot-here](images/dn-invite-bot-here.png)

You will get a screen that looks like the following screenshot.

![!dn-invite-bot-discord](images/dn-invite-bot-discord.png)

1. Select the server the bot should join.
1. Click on `Continue` to approve.

!!! note
    Check [Discord Permissions](https://notifiarr.wiki/en/Website/Discord/Permissions)){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} for information which permissions the bot needs.

#### Reactions

Here we will setup the Notifiarr reactions(emoji's) that will be shown during a playback in plex, or during a download/import in Sonarr/Radarr.

![dn-reaction-1](images/dn-reaction-1.png)![dn-reaction-2](images/dn-reaction-2.png)

This section exist of 2 parts.

1. *arr state (grab/failed) and play state of plex.
1. The Trackers/Indexers.

First we're going to download the emoji's and you can do that in 2 ways.

1. 1 at a time - Right click -> Save As... - for these emoji images to some location on your computer.
1. Pack Download - Click [here](https://notifiarr.com/setup.php?grab=reactions){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} to download a zip of all the current reaction images.

!!! attention

    To download the Emoji Pack from the link in this Guide you will need to be logged in  to [Notifiarr](https://notifiarr.com/index.php){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} site !!!

    Else you can find it on the main Notifiarr site in the `Integration Setup` Category at the bottom right

    ![!dn-pack-download](images/dn-pack-download.png)

For this example, we will be using Pack Download.  You'll need download the file and then unpack it somewhere on your computer.  After which, you can then add the emoji's to your Discord Server easily.

How to add your own Emoji's => [LINK](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036479811-Custom-Emojis){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

After you've added them to your Discord Server it's time to get the ID's from your emoji's, to do this go in to one of your channels and type:

```bash
\:emoji_name:
```

??? example "Example"
    ![!dn-emoji-example](images/dn-emoji-example.png)

    What results in to.

    ![!dn-emoji-result](images/dn-emoji-result.png)

    So your ID would be `:grab:706535455876710461`.

Paste the ID results from your channel in to the corresponding boxes.

![!dn-reaction-paste](images/dn-reaction-paste.png)

Do this for all the other boxes also including your Trackers/Indexers.

#### Trackers and Indexers

![!dn-reaction-indexers](images/dn-reaction-indexers.png)

1. Paste here the the emoji ID.
1. The actual indexer name you're using in Sonarr/Radarr.

??? example "Example"

    ![!dn-indexer-torznab](images/dn-indexer-torznab.png)

    What will result in to.

    ![!dn-indexer-torznab-result](images/dn-indexer-torznab-result.png)

    If you use a different name in Sonarr and Radarr just add them with a comma `BeyondHD - Jackett,BHD`.

Don't forget to click on `Save Changes` !!!

!!! note
    After pasting the Emoji's ID in to the box you will notice that the leading colon will disappear nothing to worry about that's per design
