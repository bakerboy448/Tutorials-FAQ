# How to add a Movie Collection

One of the coolest new features in Radarr v3 in my opinion.

The option to add movies collection based on a movie you already got.

So lets say you add a movie like `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl` and you actually want to have the other movies from the same collection.

Now you can let Radarr add them for you with just a few simple clicks

## How to add the collection lists

First go to the movie where you want to add the collection from, and click on the `collection` flag
