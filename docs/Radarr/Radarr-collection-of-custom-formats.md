# Collection of Custom Formats

Here I will try to collect a collection of the most needed and commonly used Custom Formats.
These have been collected from either discussions on discord or that I created with help from others.
Special thanks to [rg9400](https://github.com/rg9400), [bakerboy448](https://github.com/bakerboy448) and Team Radarr.

With Radarr V3, Custom Formats are much more advanced/powerful than with v0.2, although this also means a Custom Format is much more complicated to setup.

After requesting at Team Radarr we now have the options to import/export the Custom Formats in a JSON format that we can use here what makes it easier to share the different kind of Custom Formats.

I also made 2 guides related to this one.

- [How to import Custom Formats](/Radarr/Radarr-import-custom-formats){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Where I will try to explain how to import the Custom Formats.
- [How to setup Custom Formats](/Radarr/Radarr-setup-custom-formats){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} Where I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats and show some personal examples that I'm using. That you can use to get a idea how to setup yours.

!!! tip

    I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Radarr

    `Media Management` => `File Management` to `Do Not Prefer` and use the [Repack/Proper](#repack-proper) Custom Format.

    ![!cf-mm-propers-repacks-disable](images/cf-mm-propers-repacks-disable.png)

    This way you make sure the Custom Formats preferences will be used and not ignored.

>DTS-HD Master Audio is a multi-channel, lossless audio codec developed by DTS as an extension of the lossy DTS Coherent Acoustics codec (DTS CA; usually itself referred to as just DTS). Rather than being an entirely new coding mechanism, DTS-HD MA encodes an audio master in lossy DTS first, then stores a concurrent stream of supplementary data representing whatever the DTS encoder discarded. This gives DTS-HD MA a lossy "core" able to be played back by devices that cannot decode the more complex lossless audio. DTS-HD MA's primary application is audio storage and playback for Blu-ray Disc media.

>High-dynamic-range video (HDR video) is video having a dynamic range greater than that of standard-dynamic-range video (SDR video).HDR video involves capture, production, content/encoding, and display. HDR capture and displays are capable of brighter whites and deeper blacks. To accommodate this, HDR encoding standards allow for a higher maximum luminance and use at least a 10-bit dynamic range (color depth, compared to 8-bit for non-professional and 10-bit for professional SDR video) in order to maintain precision across this extended range.

### 4K Remaster

>A remastered or mastered in 4K should give you usually the best picture and audio currently for the movie. Both are just names to describe the best possible currently for the movie.
>
>To be clear, the final digital films on the Mastered in 4K Blu-rays still only have the same 1920 x 1080 pixels of actual resolution as normal Blu-rays. But the argument goes that because these full HD files were derived from higher-resolution masters, their images will be more precise, with better colours, less noise, and enhanced sharpness and detail. Not least because the higher-resolution mastering process will provide more detail from the original print for the Blu-ray masters to draw on when going through their (hopefully…) frame-by-frame compression process.
>
>Another important element of the Mastered in 4K discs is that they’re all mastered with ‘x.v.YCC’ colour specification. This delivers an expanded colour range closer to that contained in original source material.

### BR-DISK

>This is a custom format to help Radarr recognize & ignore BR-DISK (ISO's and Blu-ray folder structure) in addition to the standard BR-DISK quality.
>
>You will need to add the following to your new Custom Format when created in your Quality Profile (`Setting` => `Profiles`) and then set the score to `-1000` or even `-9999`

!!! note

    Depending on your renaming scheme it could happen that Radarr will match renamed files after they are downloaded and imported as `BR-DISK`,
    This is a cosmetic annoyance till I come up for another way to solve this,
    being that this Custom Format is used to not download BR-DISK it does its purpose as intended.
    Several reasons why this is happening:

    - Blame the often wrongly used naming of x265 encodes.
    - Radarr v3 uses dynamic custom formats.

    - BLOCK2 = Another Small list of often banned groups.
    - BLOCK3 = And Another list.

    - BLOCK5 = RiffTrax is an American company that produces scripted humorous audio commentary tracks intended to be played in unison with particular television programs and films, In short just annoying !!!
