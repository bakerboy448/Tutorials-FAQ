# Quality Settings (File Size)

I often get the question what's the best Quality Settings to use,
Well it's actually personal preference so I will show you a recommended Quality Settings.
But before you continue to read, as with all my guides:

!!! question ""
    **If you don't care about quality then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you.**

This Quality Settings has been created and tested with info I got from others, and release comparisons from different sources.

??? question "FAQ"

    ## FAQ

    **Q: Why do you only show starting from HDTV720p?**

    A: With the big screens these days anything lower doesn't look watchable

    **Q: Why do you have some sized set to max?**

    A: You probably didn't read the bold text above

    **Q: When I set Bluray to MAX size I get often ISO's/ Bluray folder structure.**

    A: You probable have configured your Quality Profiles wrong and enabled BR-DISK and didn't add the recommended Custom Profile to help Radarr to block/ignore it. [BR-DISK](/Radarr/Radarr-collection-of-custom-formats/#br-disk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

    **Q: Some movies won't be grabbed because of these settings.**

    A: If you notice that some movies won't be grabbed because of these size settings you can provide me a proof with a screenshot and the error it shows you when you do a interactive search (non redacted except the indexer/tracker if you want to).

    - I will only accept changes that are International releases no multi, or dubbed language releases.
    - I won't accept mislabeled source releases like from MeGusta, etc (they should learn to name their stuff decent first).
    - I won't accept changes for micro sized releases.
    - Documentaries and cartoons are often much smaller so I probably won't edit those either.

!!! note
    The reason why you don't see the preferred score in the Table is because we want max quality anyway so as high as possible.

    The highest preferred quality you can manually enter is 1 less than the Maximum quality. If you use the slider, the preferred quality can be up to 5 lesser than the Maximum quality.

    Make sure you have enabled 'Show Advanced' in Radarr, if you don't see a provision to enter the scores, under the Quality settings.
